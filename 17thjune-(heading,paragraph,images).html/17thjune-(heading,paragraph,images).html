    <h2>  Travels with Charley in Search of America </h2>
    <h3><u>By John Steinbeck</u></h3>
    <br>
    <pre  >
    <b>  
    <p align = "centre"> 
    In 1960, John Steinbeck left Long Island and hit the open road in a pickup truck with a 
    camper and a French poodle named Charley, embarking upon a road trip across the United
    States and back. Steinbeck visits National Parks, eats at roadside diners, and makes random 
    acquaintances.All this spurs conversations with Charley about the state of the country and
    its people.

    <b>
    Steinbeck documented his epic journey in Travels with Charley in Search of America. 
    This insightful book transformed how I look at my country and my role in society.
    It evoked a strong need to see the U.S. but also compelled me to explore the bigger world.
    The great American road trip appeals to us on many levels: our yearning for freedom and 
    expansion,a need for companionship, and our drive for individuality while also seeking the
     protection of a common identity. This book reminds us that while change is constant, progress 
     is slow.
